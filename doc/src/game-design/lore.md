# Game Lore

The idea behind the game is to be a kind of 'trojan horse', in the sense that is has 2 different levels of
meaning, where one is the more surface level one that is meant to be just fun, attention grabbing and
aesthetically pleasing and it serves as the vehicle to convey the deeper meaning that won't be told in
any explicit way but more something that has to be discovered.
That being said the deeper meaning will still be 'experienced' even if the player doesn't discover it.
More on that in a bit.

The surface level of meaning is that it's a sci-fi world where humanity discovers a new planet with life
on it, but the planet is almost entirely covered by a thick ice/snow layer similar to Hoth from Star Wars.
The planet's inhabitants all live in deep cave systems below the surface, heated by geothermal energy.
The deeper the caves the warmer it gets, creating a deep network of biomes and ecosystems.

The player is one of the first settlers on the planet, and the game is meant to be something like a Red
Dead Redemption in space. Where the player has a lot of freedom to just explore the beautiful
underground alien landscapes and seek their own meaning and goals within that world, while
occasionally returning to the surface to trade and share knowledge with the other settlers.
The main goal behind this surface layer of meaning is to create a feeling of 'awe' and curiosity and put
the player in an engaged and attentive state.

The deeper level of meaning can be split into 2 categories. The first is still told in an explicit way, in the
form of a plot twist at the end of the game:
It turns out the entire planet is something similar to a massive hivemind embryo, which uses one of the
core properties of advanced civilizations - curiosity - as a way to lure them further down towards the
planet's center.
The various creatures the player fights on the way down are a sort of selection mechanism, a kind of
challenge where only a new unique strategy can solve it and reach the bottom.
Once the player reaches the bottom, the planet 'consumes' it and all the data the player generated on
their way down. The planet then recallibrates to account for the new data, and the game starts over with
a new settler arriving on the planet. But now the planet is evolved and the challenges it presents are
more complex.
This could sound like a kind of 'space horror' ending, but that's actually not the intention. This leads to
the final layer of meaning, the one that is not told explicitly but only told through the design of the
game itself.

The final level of meaning is inspired by various scientific and mathematical theories, the most notable
ones by Donald Hoffman and Stephen Wolfram.
The concept I want to explore in the deepest level of this game is the idea that mathematics could be
the foundational layer of reality, consciousness and even emotional states.
For example, you can define a triangle as '3 points connected together' but you can also define a
triangle as 'an experience'.
Similar with colors, frequencies, etc. With those it's actually more obvious to us. We know that red
feels different to green, and also that different musical frequencies create different experiences.
And then from those ‘atomic’ building blocks you can form any complex emotional state.
And the idea is to invite the player to *experience* mathematics, instead of just understanding it.
Experience how prime numbers feel, compared to even numbers, experience the fibonacci sequence
and how different it feels from say the mandelbrot set.
So how we achieve this in game, is by precisely tuning various parameters, to create mathematical
relationships between them.
- We pick a 'fundamental frequency' that will tie everything together. In this case this ‘fundamental’ is 12.
- All animations will play at 12fps (12hz).
- All music will have a fundamental frequency of 48hz (exact 2 octaves above animations).
- All rhythm will be 90bpm (again the same 'fundamental' just a few octaves lower).
- Size of tiles will be 6x6 pixels (1/2 of 12).
- Player height is exactly 12p pixels.
- And many many more things like these.

This is meant to create a highly 'resonant' and meditative experience, where the entire experience is
tightly synchronized.
It won't be made obvious to the player, at best it will just 'feel good'.
And then once we establish the fundamental, we can start exploring different mathematical concepts
with it.
Create musical patterns between various mathematical sequences and see how they feel.
Create certain levels in game let's say using only prime number multiples of the base tiles as platform
lengths. Since animation frequency will be tied to rhythm and pitch, various lengths of animations will
create different kinds of time divisions/polyrhythms, generating even more complex structures.
And all of those mediums will create different kinds of synergies together.
Say hearing prime number based music sequence while exploring a fibonacci based level, etc etc.
Again, the goal is not to make this obvious, and make it something that the player experiences
subconsciously, while being focused and entertained by the surface level of meaning.
And then the idea behind the game ending, with the planet recallibrating, together with the
mathematical meaning, is meant to touch on the topic of the ruliad / 'godel's infinite candy store'.
The idea that as we find new potential mathematic/conscious states it opens up the doors to even newer
ones, in an infinite loop of conscious expansion.
Every iteration of the game open up brand new conscious experiences based on the previous
playthrough.
And it's important to mention the player is also an 'instrument' here.
Due to the animation sync all their actions produce sfx sounds that will be synced to some division of
the base fundamental frequency.
So what the player does in each iteration, influence by the new callibration of the planet, is a key part
of the whole experience, and those actions by the player influence the future configuration, etc, creating
a feedback loop that keeps generates new mathematical/conscious structures.
