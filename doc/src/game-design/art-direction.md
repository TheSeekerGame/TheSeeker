# Art Direction

- Low-res pixel art (6x6 tile size, 12px player height)
- Low saturation
- No outlines
- Focus on good readability and color harmony
- Player should ideally be the only yellow'y asset in game to make it very visible
- All assets drawn fully lit and then darkness added as a post processing shader
- Multi-layered and parallaxed background and foregrounds
- Focus on auto-tiling, to save time designing levels
- Backgrounds and foreground mostly simple silhouettes so attention is on the main platforms
- Procedural fogs and blur layers to build atmosphere and make backgrounds grab even less attention
- Atmospheric lighting and bloom™️ 
- I would love to have lighting with normal maps at some point but it might be too much work
- All animations play at 12fps
- Shaders for environment so it reacts to player (like vegetation moves when you run through it, or water splashes etc)
- Procedural 'dust' trail behind player when jumping (like in hollow knight)
