# Gameplay / Mechanics

The overall idea is to have a game that combines open sandboxy exploration with intense combat and itemization mechanics


**EXPLORATION**

On the exploration front this can be seen as a combination of the overall feel of a sandbox game (Red Dead Redemption style, but in a 2D setting) with some Metroidvania mechanics (similar to Hollow Knight)
The metroidvania mechanics here are mostly the platformer style gameplay with the typical 'teasing of certain locked areas' where the player needs to get some item or ability to access those areas.
The locked areas don't have as much of a gamplay significance as in Metroidvanias, instead they are used more as just a way to motivate the player to explore.
This motivation will be the core driver of progress in this game, as there won't be any explicit 'quest' given to the player. (There will be side-quests but no overarching grand mission)
Instead the player explores the deep alien cave systems mostly out of curiosity and the will to experience more of the hidden beauty of the planet.
Therefore various mechanics need to really prioritize feeding this curiosity to make this design work.


**COMBAT AND ITEMIZATION**

Combat and itemization take a lot of inspiration from games like Diablo and Risk of Rain.
On the build/combat side that means prioritizing synergy - giving player a wide range of skills and items that can all interact with each other in interesting ways, while trying to minimize incompatible combinations. This also ties back into the idea of curiosity: the player is not only driven by trying to explore the world, but also by trying to explore the various *ways of exploring* this world, in the form of countless different playstyles.
This is also tied into itemization, where item drops are specific to certain creatures/species and so that in turn motivates the player to explore various areas of the map to kill those creatures to be able to obtain their items which in turn can be used in crafting to enable new build combinations. ðŸ”„ 
At the same time the various creatures have different strengths and weaknesses, so the player might need to swap builds in preparation for fighting in different areas.
For instance creatures in cold areas might be more vulnerable to fire builds, while creatures in magma biomes might be more vulnerable to cold builds.
Item drops will also be creature-dependent. This creates a potential gameplay scenario where for instance you might need to go kill some fiery creatures to get fire items, and then those items will allow you to explore some icy area better and vice-versa. Again incentivizing exploration and curiosity.
So overall there's a nice feedback loop  within this design where all the parts synergize to incentivise exploration and curiosity, both in the area of mechanics and in the area of actual world exploration.
