# Platforming

Platforming is very similar to hollow knight:
- variable jump height
- double jump
- wall slide/kick
- coyote time
- fall part of the jump slightly faster than the jump part, to make it less floaty

I would like platforming puzzles to be an important, though mostly optional part of the game, where players can access hidden areas and get interesting items by completing difficult platforming challenges
but being good at platforming will not be needed to enjoy the game
