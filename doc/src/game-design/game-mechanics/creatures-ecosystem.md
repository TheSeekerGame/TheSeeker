# Creatures / Ecosystem

creatures are divided into those 3 overall categories:
1) Herbivores
2) Carnivores
3) Scavengers

**Herbivores** are mostly limited to specific 'oasis' areas in the caves where heat and water from geysers causes vegetation to grow which they can eat.
One problem for them is that they are obvious targets in those areas, so they usually go there only briefly to eat and then hide in other areas of the cave.
They attack the player only defensively and try to run away.
Unless they have cubs, then they will attack actively.

**Carnivores** patrol large areas looking for Herbivores, but most often they sit near the oasis areas waiting for Herbivores to appear.
They will actively attack the player whenever they get near. Their 'sight' is larger than screen size so they can spot the player from farther away and start to chase them.
Their cubs behave the same way, and accompany parents during hunts

**Scavengers** patrol large areas looking for leftover meat. They attack the player only defensively and try to run away if isolated. But they will attack actively and chase the player when in larger groups.
The will always attack actively when they have cubs, and the cubs will also join them in attacking.

So for any level the minimum viable ecosystem requires 6 creatures.
1) Herbivore + cub
2) Carnivore + cub
3) Scavenger + cub

There might also be additional creatures beyond this basic ecosystem, like 'bats' that attack everything that gets near, or 'trap creatures' that just sit idle until something gets near and then strike
