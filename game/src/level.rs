//! Level Management
//!
//! This is where we manage everything related to managing the map /
//! the in-game playable space/area.
//! A "level" is one "room" in the game, connected to others.
//!
//! The player should be able to walk between them,
//! and we dynamically switch (load/unload) levels as needed.
//!
//! This module is the framework for level transitions, loading/unloading,
//! general map setup, and other such managerial stuff.
//!
//! Any of the stuff that actually *happens* within the map when you
//! play the game, doesn't belong here. Put that stuff under [`crate::game`].
